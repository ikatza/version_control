# version_control
Basic git and GitHub tutorial with a list of commands for git and a test notebook for managing branches, remotes and commits.

There's also a `pretty_terminal.txt` file taken from **How to use Git and GitHub**'s Udacity course which makes working on the bash more clear where your local git repository on the bash would look like

If changes in files are made a " \* " sign will be shown at the right of the current branch (in green). If files are added via git, a  "+"  sign will be shown at the right of the current branch.
